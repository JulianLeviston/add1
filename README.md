# add1

This project is one exercise in building up an intuition about how to write
more and more complex software using denotational and algebraic design.

This is the first program.

It is a tool that reads some positive integers (ie the naturals including 0) interactively via the CLI,
taking line based commands, and can show what's been put into the store in insertion order, and also
work out their sum, product, and statistical mean based on standard arithmetic.
