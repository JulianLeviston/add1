# Agda specification

Here we build an agda version of the spec as an exercise and to be more precise.

Ensure you open the agda directory directly in vscode if you'd like to use that project rather than the enclosing project directory otherwise vscode's agda extension won't pick up the library settings in the .vscode directory.
